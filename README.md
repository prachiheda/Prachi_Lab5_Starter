# Lab 5 - Starter

Did not work with a teammate. 

1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
  - I would not use just a unit test. This feature would require multiple unit tests for isolated logic within messages, and would require other functional tests to confirm the sender sees “sent” and the receiver sees the new message appear
  
3. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
- Yes, I would use a unit test becuase it is an isolated requirement. It is also fast and easy to verify, making it simple for a unit test.
